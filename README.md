# Computer Vision Not Just For Breakfast Anymore 

These are the slides for my talk _Computer Vision, Not Just For Breakfast Anymore_. I gave the talk multiple times and changes some content between the talks.

As the videos are posted online, I'll add the link(s) here.

The sample app that goes with the presentation is [Crushing Your Head](https://github.com/yonomitt/Crushing-Your-Head)
